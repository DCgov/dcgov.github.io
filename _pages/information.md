## Government-Wide Information

There are a number of sites where you can download and explore official DC Government data and other information.

### Data and Information Sources

The [Open Data Catalog](http://opendata.dc.gov/) provides hundreds of District government datasets, available as raw downloads in a variety of formats, and through APIs.

Outside of the Data Catalog, you can find:

* [DC Regulations and DC Register](http://dc.gov/node/148382) - District regulations, the District Register and Mayoral Orders

* [Map Data](http://dc.gov/node/850722) - map interfaces for exploring data, including crime statistics, public school profiles, detailed property information
* [Public Employee Salary Information](http://dchr.dc.gov/public-employee-salary-information) - salary information about District employees

### Government Performance Dashboards

The District also maintains several goverment performance dashboards:

* [Track DC](http://track.dc.gov/) - provides performance information on all District agencies
* [Grade DC](http://grade.dc.gov/) - reports on resident grading of 15 District agencies and enables residents to provide input for the next monthly grades
* [Green Dashboard](http://greendashboard.dc.gov/) - provides data on the District's sustainability performance

## Agency Information

### Locating Agency Records

[Agencies](http://dc.gov/directory) are required to ensure that certain records are made available to the public. Each of these records, when they exist, should be listed on the agency's [Open Government and FOIA page](http://dc.gov/page/freedom-information-act-foia-contact-information). 

For some agencies, these records do not exist and are not listed. In cases where records exist but are not yet available online, agencies are working to provide them as soon as possible.
