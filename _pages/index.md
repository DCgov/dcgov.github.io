# [Policy >>](/policy)

Building off of the 2014 Open Government and Open Data Directive, DC Government is working on a new [Open Data Policy](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy).

Members of the public can comment on it and propose edits through [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy), by email, Twitter, and mail until **February 15, 2015**. Learn more by visiting the [Policy page](/policy).

# [Getting Information >>](/information)

Much of DC Government's data and information is already available online. From regulations, to geographic information, to budget data, and more. Find out about these resources on the [Information page](/information).

If you are looking for information that is not yet public, you can submit a FOIA request (Freedom of Information Act).
