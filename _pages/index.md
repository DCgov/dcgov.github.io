# [Policy >>](/policy)

Building off of the 2014 Open Government and Open Data Directive, DC Government is working on a new [Open Data Policy](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy).

It was publicly posted to [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy), where members of the public could comment on it and propose edits. All such annotations remain visible online. The policy is being revised prior to the opening of a formal comment period. Learn more by visiting the [Policy page](/policy).

# [Getting Information >>](/information)

Much of DC Government's data and information is already available online. From regulations, to geographic information, to budget data, and more. Find out about these resources on the [Information page](/information).

If you are looking for information that is not yet public, you can submit a FOIA request (Freedom of Information Act).

# [Reaching Out >>](/contact)
