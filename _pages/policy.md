## Draft Data Policy

The District is developing a new [data policy](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/district-of-columbia-data-policy-draft). It was publicly posted to [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/district-of-columbia-data-policy-draft), where members of the public could comment on it and propose edits. All such annotations remain visible online. We are currently revising the document, taking into account all comments. Keep your eye on [the new Open Government Advisory Group page](http://ogag.dc.gov/) for updates. All future information about the policy will posted there.
