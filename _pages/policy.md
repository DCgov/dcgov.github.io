## Draft Open Data Policy

The District is developing a new [open data policy](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy). You can find the proposed policy on [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy), where it was open for public comment until February 15, 2015. We are currently reviewing responses and will revise the draft before re-opening formal comments. In the meantime, feedback remains welcome by:

* Mail c/o Open Data Policy, 200 I Street SE, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20003

## Open Government and Open Data Directive

The existing [Open Government and Open Data Directive](http://dc.gov/node/871012) provides a comprehensive plan for the District government to enhance transparency, accountability, and collaboration with District residents and the public.
