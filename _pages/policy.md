## Draft Open Data Policy

The District is developing a new [open data policy](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy). It was publicly posted to [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy), where members of the public could comment on it and propose edits. All such annotations remain visible online.

We are currently reviewing responses and will revise the draft before opening it for formal comments. In the meantime, feedback remains welcome by:

* Mail c/o Open Data Policy, 200 I Street SE, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20003
* Email to [open@dc.gov](mailto:open@dc.gov)
* Tweet to [@octodc](https://twitter.com/OCTODC) on Twitter using the hashtag #opendatadc

## Open Government and Open Data Directive

The existing [Open Government and Open Data Directive](http://dc.gov/node/871012) provides a comprehensive plan for the District government to enhance transparency, accountability, and collaboration with District residents and the public.
