# Projects

DC Government agencies are working on a variety of projects as part of the [Open Source Pilot](http://open.dc.gov/open-source-guidelines). These include websites, policy guides, documentation standards, command line tools, and more.

All are free to use and re-use. Comments, issues, and other contributions are welcome!

To learn more about these projects, you can email the open source program at [open@dc.gov](mailto:open@dc.gov).
